# Clarabase Example Apps

This repository contains a collection of example reference applications using the Clarabase platform. Each example is located in the `examples` directory, organized by the framework or language it uses, such as "python", "nextjs", etc.

## Getting Started

To run each example app, follow these steps:

1. **Generate a Client Secret:**
   - Visit the [Clarabase Authentication Guide](https://docs.clarabase.com/basics/apis-and-authentication#authentication) to generate a `client_secret`.
   - Ensure you securely copy the `client_secret` as it will only be shown once.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Add the `client_secret` to the respective `.env` file for each project. This is necessary for authenticating API requests.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Follow the specific instructions provided in each example's README to set up and run the application.
