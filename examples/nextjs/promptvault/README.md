# Getting Started

This project includes a Next.js app that contains a custom sdk for your Clarabase API. All of the backend routes have been autogenerated for you, and you can add your UI code and additional functionality as needed.

## Setup - Generate Client Credentials

First, visit the Clarabase App, navigate to settings, and generate a client secret. Be sure to save the secret as it will only be shown once. Copy the client id and client secret to the .env.local file:

```bash
CLARABASE_BASE_URL=https://api.clarabase.com
CLARABASE_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
CLARABASE_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
```

Be sure not to use the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for these variables, particularly the client id and client secret as they are sensitive.

## Install

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev
```
